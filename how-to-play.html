    <p><span style="color: yellow;background-color: cadetblue">Our team has put together a two to four player game to be played on a single computer based on the popular board game "Sorry!"</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: yellow;background-color: cadetblue">The goal of this game is to be the first player to get all four of their colored pawns from their "start" space, around the board to their "home" space. The pawns are normally moved in a clockwise direction but can be moved backward if directed. Movement of pawns is directed by the drawing of a card.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: yellow;background-color: cadetblue">In the initial page, accessed by the "New Game" link in the top right corner, each player selects a color by checking the corresponding box. When all players have chosen their respective color, click the "submit" button to start a new game.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: yellow;background-color: cadetblue">One player is selected to play first. Each player, in turn, draws one card from the deck by clicking on the deck and follows the card instructions. To begin the game, all of a player's four pawns are restricted to Start; a player can only move them out onto the rest of the board if he or she draws a 1 or 2 card. A 1 or a 2 places a pawn on the space directly outside of start (a 2 does not entitle the pawn to move a second space).</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: yellow;background-color: cadetblue">A pawn can jump over any other pawn during its move. However, two pawns cannot occupy the same square; a pawn that lands on a square occupied by another player's pawn "bumps" that pawn back to its own Start. Players can not bump their own pawns back to Start; if the only way to complete a move would result in a player bumping their own pawn, the player's pawns remain in place and the player loses their turn.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: yellow;background-color: cadetblue">If a pawn lands at the start of a slide (except those of its own color), either by direct movement or as the result of a switch from an 11 card or a Sorry card, it immediately "slides" to the last square of the slide. All pawns on all spaces of the slide (including those belonging to the sliding player) are sent back to their respective Starts.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: yellow;background-color: cadetblue">The last five squares before each player's Home are "Safety Zones", and are specially colored corresponding to the colors of the Homes they lead to. Access is limited to pawns of the same color. Pawns inside the Safety Zones are immune to being bumped by opponents' pawns or being switched with opponents' pawns via 11 or Sorry! cards. However, if a pawn is forced via a 10 or 4 card to move backward out of the Safety Zone, it is no longer considered "safe" and may be bumped by or switched with opponents' pawns as usual until it re-enters the Safety Zone.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: yellow;background-color: cadetblue">The deck contains 45 cards: five 1 cards as well as 4 of the other cards (Sorry!, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12). These a randomly ordered and placed face down in the area labeled "Place Pack Here". To select a card, the player whose turn it is, click on the deck. One card is "turned over" and displayed in the "Discard Here" area. The player then moves a pawn based on the card's instructions. Once a player has made their move, they click the "Done" button and the next player takes their turn.</span></p>
    <nav class="wiki_link"><p><span style="background-color: red">Note: The rules shown on the cards are an abbreviated version due to space limitations. For a complete set of rules take a look at the Wikipedia page, specifically the "Classic cards and function" section by clicking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)">here</a></span></p></nav>
