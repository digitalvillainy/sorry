I'm adding notes in this txt file because you cannot add comments to
json files and if you try to, it causes errors and looks super messy.

Object called coordinates is what I made for storing the current location
of each of the player's pawns.
Pawns are of a certain color and each color of pawn corresponds to a color
name and also a letter which tells us which of the player's 4 pawns it is.
We have pawns a-d for each player.

The "safe" object tells us if the pawn is at a location where it cannot be moved by another
player's pawn. These spots are start, safe, and home zones. Any other location
it is at isn't considered safe.

For the cards: I am not sure if we will need to have something to keep track
of cards in discard and cards in draw pile, but I added "discardCards" and "deckCards" in there for now. 

The "status" object within the "game" object is what we will use to figure out if
the came has concluded (someone won) or if it is ongoing.

// player and game

// Game will be the parent object for cards in draw and cards in discard (maybe), the status (done or not)
// and state (which is mostly taken care of by player object)
